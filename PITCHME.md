## HICSS-51

### How can we apply new technologies to academic conferences?

+++

### Motivation

- _"Better understand how and why people attend sessions..." <br> Conference Chair_ |
- _"Tired of running around and manually counting attendees... " <br> Conference Organizer_|
- _"What do I get out of coming to the conference? " <br> Attendee_ |

+++

### BI Questions

- Are there patterns in the way people attend workshops? |
- Are there cliques at academic conferences?  |
- Can we provide an improved attendee experience? |
