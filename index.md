## Lab 3a: Power BI - Part 1

### Objective

Building executive dashboards with Power BI Desktop and publishing them to Power BI Online.

### Status

In-Works, due after class 9/15

### Task

[Google Classrom Lab Activities](https://goo.gl/RC1oGZ).

Now that we have learned the fundamental aspects of building dashboards, it's time to use our acquired knowledge from Tableau to learn visual data exploration with Power BI Desktop. You will notice that many procedures and tools are very similar, the only differences lie in the execution of commands.

Please load the Coffee-Chain dataset attached in Power BI Desktop and select three tables of location, product, and sales. We will learn about Power BI Desktop using this dataset. For your assignment, you only need to clean up the dataset, create a data model, develop a business dashboard with at least four KPIs, upload the dashboard to Power BI Online and submit the URL on Google Classroom.  

Note: By sharing your dashboard with me (hsmidt@hawaii.edu) on Power BI Online, you can create a required link and give me permission to view.

### Dataset

We will use the [Coffee-Chain dataset](https://goo.gl/HQbUXr).
